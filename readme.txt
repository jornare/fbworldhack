			<h3>About Skeleton?</h3>
			<p>Skeleton is a small collection of well-organized CSS files that can help you rapidly develop sites that look beautiful at any size, be it a 17" laptop screen or an iPhone. It's based on a responsive grid, but also provides very basic CSS for typography, buttons, forms and media queries. Go ahead, resize this super basic page to see the grid in action.</p>

		<div class="one-third column">
			<h3>Three Core Principles</h3>
			<p>Skeleton is built on three core principles:</p>
			<ul class="square">
				<li><strong>A Responsive Grid Down To Mobile</strong>: Elegant scaling from a browser to tablets to mobile.</li>
				<li><strong>Fast to Start</strong>: It's a tool for rapid development with best practices</li>
				<li><strong>Style Agnostic</strong>: It provides the most basic, beautiful styles, but is meant to be overwritten.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
